This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit type conversion. The `bug.vbs` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version. The issue stems from how VBScript handles the assignment of different data types within a function without explicit declarations.  The solution involves explicit type declarations to enforce correct type handling and avoid unexpected conversions.
